# Angular2-upload-Amazon-S3-from-client-side

Important : This project goes with his Back-end : .Net-core-upload-Amazon-S3

Here it's a simple project for upload files from your client-side directly to your Amazon S3. No more upload to the back-end first, thanks to the signature we build which allow a permission to the file.

Hope that help !
